# MCWQM
Developing Chl-a and water turbidity estimates using artificial intelligence

The MCWQM Project is funded by the Department of Science and Technology and 
monitored by the Philippine Council for Industry, Energy, and Emerging Technology Research and Development (DOST-PCIEERD). 
It is implemented by the UP Training Center for Applied Geodesy and Photogrammetry (TCAGP) in collaboration with the 
Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA). It aims to develop long-term and short-term water quality monitoring systems 
using remote sensing, geospatial analysis, and artificial intelligence.

Dataframe consists of bands from Sentinel 2A image as feautures which corresponds to blue, red, red edge 1-4, and short wave infrareds 1 and 2. Chla and Turbidity were in-situ data
